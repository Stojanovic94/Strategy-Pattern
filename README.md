# User Management System with Strategy Pattern

This project demonstrates a system for managing different types of users on a web platform. Each user type has unique privileges and access to specific features. The project utilizes the **Strategy Pattern** to implement user-specific behaviors dynamically, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

## Design Pattern Overview: Strategy

### Purpose
The **Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the behavior of an object to be selected at runtime.

### Key Features
- **Encapsulation of Behavior**: Each behavior (or algorithm) is encapsulated in its own class.
- **Dynamic Selection**: Behavior can be dynamically assigned and changed during runtime.
- **Extensibility**: Adding new behaviors doesn't require modifying existing code.
